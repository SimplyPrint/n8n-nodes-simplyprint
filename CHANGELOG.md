# Changelog

All notable changes to `n8n-nodes-simplyprint` are documented here.

## 0.2.0

- Collapse 15 per-event trigger classes into a single `SimplyPrint Trigger` node with an Event dropdown. This matches the pattern used by first-party n8n integrations (HubSpot, Slack, Stripe) and makes the triggers appear correctly under the SimplyPrint integration card in the Node Creator (previously every event rendered as its own standalone card and the integration overview showed "No SimplyPrint Triggers available").
- Default both credentials' `Panel URL` to `https://simplyprint.io` (production) instead of the staging host.
- Drop the internal `install-on-home-server.sh` dev-loop script from the repo.

## 0.1.0 - Initial release

- Dual authentication (OAuth2 or API key) via a per-node authentication selector
- Main `SimplyPrint` action node with 8 resources and ~30 operations
- Custom API Call resource as an escape hatch for any unwrapped endpoint
- 15 webhook-based trigger nodes, one per SimplyPrint event
- Dynamic loadOptions dropdowns for printers, files, queue items, queue groups, filaments, tags and custom fields
- Constant-time webhook signature verification against per-workflow secrets
